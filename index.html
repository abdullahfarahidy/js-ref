        &nbsp;  Dear sir or madam,<br>
It’s so significant for me to reveal my intentions and motivation
about studying in Turkey. As a high school graduate looking for highquality education, hands-on experiences during my studies,
opportunities to improve academically during and after my studies, and
most importantly a safe and friendly environment and a diverse
creative community, I think that Turkey is the best place to fulfill my
needs and achieve my dream, cities like Istanbul and Ankara have a
strong international community and world-renowned universities,
making it a leading location within the arena of higher education.
I believe taking a mechanical engineering program can enormously
change my life. Such field promises the best of Engineering and
Business. It will help me acquire skills in the design, building creative
systems, and optimization of mechanical machines in industrial and
non-industrial processes.
I think Today’s competitive world needs managers and decisionmakers who can apply mathematical concepts and scientific
management techniques to the technical problems that arise. I believe
completing this program enables me to be a mechanical engineer who
doesn’t only understand these problems but is able to devise and
implement methods to solve them. After graduation, I would like to use
my knowledge and experience gained from the program in creating
projects that document the relationship between Egypt and turkey.<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Abdallah Ahmed.
